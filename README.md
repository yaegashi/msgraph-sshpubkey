# WIP: msgraph-sshpubkey

This app will allow you to manage SSH public keys nicely in Azure Active Directory via Microsoft Graph API.

It's a spin-off project of https://github.com/yaegashi/msgraph.go/tree/master/cmd/msgraph-sshpubkey.

I'm currently developing the admin web app using React frontend and Go backend.
